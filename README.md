## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML CSS JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

It was quite a big gap between the mobile view and desktop view. Tried my best to style the layout for the in-between sizes in a way that makes sense. Looking at it, I think it's servicable but there are likely better ways of doing it.
